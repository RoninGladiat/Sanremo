# Sanremo
This is a project in which sessions, JSP pages, ArrayLists and object oriented programming are used. On the index.jsp page I print all the various artists of Sanremo using the Bootstrap cards and clicking on the button will take us to the second JSP page (voto.jsp) I allow the user to vote for the artist and send the vote via a button that di will redirect to the first page (index.jsp) and save to vote in the ArraList with a string whose sentence will be decided on the basis of the entered vote.
At the bottom of the page (index.jsp) we can find a link that will take us to the final page (Tabella-voti.jsp) that will show us the name of the artist, the image and the string with the corresponding phrase on the screen.
